            <h2>Couton shirt</h2>
            <p>A shirt is a cloth garment for the upper body (from the neck to the waist).
              Originally an undergarment worn exclusively by men, it has become, in American 
              English, a catch-all term for a broad variety of upper-body garments and undergarments.
               In British English, a shirt is more specifically a garment with a collar, sleeves with
                cuffs, and a full vertical opening with buttons or snaps (North Americans would call
                 that a "dress shirt", a specific type of collared shirt). A shirt can also be worn
                  with The shirt was an item of clothing that only men could wear as underwear, until
                   the twentieth century.[2] Although the women's chemise was a closely related garment
                    to the men's, it is the men's garment that became the modern shirt.</p>

            <h2>Couton-Blazar</h2>
            <p>A blazer is a type of jacket resembling a suit jacket, but cut more casually. 
                A blazer is generally distinguished from a sport
                 coat as a more formal garment and tailored from solid colour fabrics. Blazers
                  often have naval-style metal buttons to reflect their origins as jackets worn
                   by boating club members.[1]Blazers are worn with a wide variety of clothes, 
                   ranging from a dress shirt and necktie to an open-necked polo shirt, or even
                    just a plain T-shirt. They are seen with trousers of all 
                   colours and fabrics, from the classic white cotton or linen, to grey flannel, 
                   to brown or beige chinos, and also jeans.A blazer's cloth is usually durable,
                    as it is intended as outdoor wear. Blazers are often part of a uniform that.</p>

            <h2>T-shirt</h2>
            <p>A T-shirt, or tee shirt, is a style of fabric shirt named after the T shape of its body and sleeves.
                 Traditionally, it has short sleeves and a round neckline, known as a crew neck, which lacks a collar.
                  T-shirts are generally made of a stretchy, light and inexpensive fabric and are easy to clean. 
                  Typically made of cotton textile in a stockinette or jersey knit, it has a distinctively pliable
                   texture compared to shirts made of woven cloth. Some modern versions have a body made from a
                    continuously knitted tube, produced on a circular knitting machine, such that the torso has
                     no side seams. The manufacture of T-shirts has become highly automated and may include cutting
                      fabric with a laser or a water jet</p>
